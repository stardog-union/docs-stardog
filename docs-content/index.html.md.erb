and analyze all enterprise data. Stardog Service Broker for PCF allows apps to 
easily connect to a Stardog server or cluster.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Stardog Service Broker for PCF enables PCF app developers to connect to a Stardog server.

Stardog Service Broker for PCF supports a pre-provisioned service plan called
**perinstance**. A Stardog server must be started out of band and at a
location that PCF can address. When a service instance is created with
the **perinstance** plan the URL and administrator credentials to that
Stardog server must be provided.  The service broker uses that information
to create a Stardog database and associates it with the service
instance.  When an app is bound to that service instance, a new
user is created and granted access to that database and that username is
associated with the bound app.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features

Stardog Service Broker for PCF includes the following key features:
